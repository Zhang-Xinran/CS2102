# Database Systems Design Project
The project aims to design a database that holds the information for a company that conducts various one-day IT courses throughout the year.

The database is designed in Postgresql. The command for creating the table is stored in schema.sql. The command for creating functions is stored in proc.sql. The command for inserting the data is in data.sql.
